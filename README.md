# Medication Tracker

[This application is still in development.]

The purpose of this application is to allow users to record and track the use of medications. This application will help users keep track of medicines with specific days on/days off cycles (i.e., take a medicine for 25 days; skip for 5 days; repeat).

## Registration

Before using the application, a user must register by providing an email address and creating a password. When the application is opened, and a user is not logged in, the user is redirected to the Login page. A link to the Registration page is located near the bottom of the Login page.

## Pages

### Medicine Schedule
Once the user is authenticated, the user will be taken to the Medicine Schedule page. The Medicine Schedule page lists all medications the user should take for the current day. Links to the **Medication List** and to **Add a Medicine** can be be found in the site's navigation bar.

### Medication List
The Medication List page contains a table listing all medications the user has recorded. This page has links to **Details, Edit, and Delete**.

### Create/Edit
A user can record information about a medicine.

### Not Found
If a user's medicine is not found, a custom 404 - Not Found page is displayed.
